# Interests

I have extensive experience in data analysis using Python and R and in machine learning model development using PyTorch, Keras, and LLM. I am particularly drawn to building scalable data analysis pipelines, developing deep learning models for image segmentation, and integrating LLM in intuitive user interfaces. I am a collaborative team player with a strong commitment to continuous learning and am excited to contribute my problem-solving abilities to a dynamic team.
